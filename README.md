## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

While working on this project, I polished my old learnings like how to use "the hover" (I was able to use it without seeking for any help from the internet or even my previous projects) and also was easily able to make the page responsive. Though I did not learn anything new, but I am glad this project helped in polishing the old learnings. 

### Continued development

I am still facing some problems with making the page responsive, this could be because of the lack of knowledge I have about the topic. I would learn more on it and make the webpages responsive at more breakpoints.
